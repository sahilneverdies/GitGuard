## ðŸ”’ Privacy Policy for GitGuard

Effective Date: `July 18, 2025`

Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines what data GitGuard may collect and how it is handled:

### 1. **Data Collected**

GitGuard may temporarily collect the following data for functionality purposes:

* Discord user ID (for logging or permission checks)
* Guild/server ID and name
* Channel IDs or message IDs related to bot usage
* GitHub usernames or repository data (if user-supplied)
* Command usage logs (for improvement and debugging)

**Note:** GitGuard does **not** collect:

* Messages sent by users (unless the bot is explicitly designed to monitor them)
* Personal identifying information (PII) beyond Discord IDs

### 2. **Data Storage**

* Data may be stored temporarily in memory or logs for debugging or analytics purposes.
* No data is shared with third parties.
* Logs are retained only for as long as needed to ensure bot functionality and security.

### 3. **Your Rights**

* You can request removal of stored data by contacting the bot developer.
* Leaving a server with GitGuard will remove any ongoing collection specific to that server.

### 4. **Third-Party Services**

GitGuard may interact with external APIs (e.g., GitHub) for features. GitHubâ€™s [Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) applies when using those services.
